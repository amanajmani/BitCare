# BitCare

A react native application that will accept a bitcoin address as user input and
allow the user to see how much bitcoin is associated with the address and
display a list of all transactions made to that address. Additionally, use
the library bitcoinjs-lib to create a new address on a separate screen.
Send some test bitcoin to the newly created address using this faucet -
https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/ and a "Send" button to sign and
broadcast a transaction from the user's address back to the faucet address
at the bottom of the page.
